# Spotify-Clone
I built a Spotify Clone using HTML &amp; CSS, replicating the UI of the popular music streaming platform with a responsive design, sidebar navigation, and music player controls (UI only). This project enhanced my frontend development skills, focusing on UI/UX design, layout structuring, and responsiveness.
